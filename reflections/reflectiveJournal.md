## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
Scratch is a high-level block-based programming language and website.
### What is visual programming?
Visual programming lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.
### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?

### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
[Here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/717595495/) is a basic pong game.
## Week 2:

### What is git?
Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
### What is GitHub?
GitHub is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
## Week 3 Python tasks:

month = input("Which month would you like to know the length of? ")
if month == "January" or month == "March" or month == "May" or month == "July" or month == "August" or month == "October" or month == "December":
    print("There are 31 days in",month + ".")
elif month == "April" or month == "June" or month == "September" or month == "November":
    print("There are 30 days in",month + ".")
elif month == "February":
    print("There are 28 days in",month +", or 29 days on a leap year.")
    
**_This is a very long and drawn out way to write this code, I need to practice with lists!!
